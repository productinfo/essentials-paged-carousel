ShinobiEssentials Paged Carousel (Objective-C)
=====================

This project provides a simple helper class (`PagedCarouselHelper`) which is reusable in your own project, and demonstrates how to use it. There is an accompanying blog post [here](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2014/02/11/building-a-paged-carousel).

See [Using PagedCarouselHelper](#PagedCarouselHelper) for more details on reusing `PagedCarouselHelper`.

Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiEssentials. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiEssentials website](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/ios/shinobiessentials/).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiEssentials, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiEssentials, open up the project in Xcode, and drag ShinobiEssentials.framework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

If you’re using the trial version you’ll need to add your license key. To do so, open up AppDelegate.m, import <ShinobiEssentials/ShinobiEssentials.h>, and set the license key inside application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: as follows:

    #import <ShinobiEssentials/ShinobiEssentials.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [ShinobiEssentials setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
        …
    }

Using PagedCarouselHelper
------------------
Here's how to use `PagedCarouselHelper` in your own project:

1. Add a carousel to your view. You'll need to use a specific subclass of `SEssentialsCarousel` - see the [`SEssentialsCarousel` overview](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/docs/ShinobiControls/ShinobiEssentials/2.5.1/Standard/Normal/Classes/SEssentialsCarousel.html#overview) for a list of carousel types. 
2. Add a page control to your view.
3. Add the **PagedCarouselHelper.h** and **PagedCarouselHelper.m** files to your project.
4. Create a `PagedCarouselHelper` instance with your carousel and page control.
5. Adjust the helper properties to the behaviour you want:
    * `itemsPerPage` determines how many views will be displayed on each page
    * `itemPadding` adjusts the spacing between the views on a page
    * `orientation` determines whether to line up the items within a page horizontally or vertically
    * `animationDuration` determines how long the animated scroll takes when the user changes the page via the page control
6. Create the `UIView`s for your carousel and add them to your helper - either one at a time with the `addView:` method, or all at once with `addViews:`.
7. Sit back and be amazed at the awesomeness of your paged carousel.

You might want to tweak your carousel settings to improve the way the carousel and page control interact - see **ViewController.m** for some ideas.

A couple of things to note:

* `PagedCarouselHelper` is designed to work with views that are all the same size, so it might not work as expected if you have differently sized views.
* `PagedCarouselHelper` adds itself as the carousel's delegate, so if you want to use any other delegate methods, then add them to `PagedCarouselHelper` (or subclass it).
